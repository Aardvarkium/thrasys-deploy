Technology.create(:title=>'Multi-Enterprise Information Model', :description=>'<p>Unlike earlier generations of healthcare solutions, SyntraNet is designed from the ground up for networks of connected enterprises.  Enterprises are modeled as nodes in a connected network with varying degrees of relationship among network participants much like a complex social network for enterprises.</p><p>In the simplest case, a SyntraNet network can be defined as a single, vertically integrated enterprise the usual model in traditional enterprise applications.  A somewhat more complex SyntraNet network is a collection of enterprises that are independent of one another a configuration equivalent to "multi-tenancy" applications.  And SyntraNet networks can be also configured to define considerably more complex topologies than multi-tenancy with hierarchies of organizations with varying degrees of relationship among participants.</p><p>With SyntraNet, applications are targeted at an entire health network with fine-grained control over data, processes, configuration and security for each participant.  The SyntraNet information and application model are unique to the industry and a new foundation for connected health information technology.</p>', :tab_title=>'Enterprise Model',:image=>File.open(root + "/picholder/technology/img_multi-enterprise_model.png"))
